    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, I decided to convert the images to grayscale because the color doesn't play an important role for classification. The signs can be identified in grayscale as well. On one hand, grayscaling can reduce the noise from color. On the other hand, the grayscale photo has just one depth. After grayscaling, the amount of input is significantly reduced.\n",

    "Here is an example of a traffic sign image before and after grayscaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](writeup_images/test_grayscale.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As the last step, I normalized the image data. Because after normalization all data are on the same scale. After this, things make no difference in the meaning of the symbol. \n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to generate additional data because the size of training now is relatively small. To avoid overfitting, I want more training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add more data to the data set, I used the following techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. shear the image\n",
    "2. rotate the image in the random angle\n",
    "3. change the exposure of an image\n",
    "4. shift the image \n",
    "5. zoom the image \n",
    "\n",
    "I used the keras and numpy to realize these distortions of images. I used one of these distortions for the original images. It depends on a random value \"lot\". For each image, only one operation will be chosen randomly. \n",

    "#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results of the training, validation and test sets and wherein the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well-known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "My final model results were:\n",
    "* training set accuracy of 0.964\n",
    "* validation set accuracy of 0.973\n",
    "* test set accuracy of 0.949\n",
    "\n",
    "If an iterative approach was chosen:\n",
    "* What was the first architecture that was tried and why was it chosen?\n",
    "    * I first used the origin LeNet, which I learned in the Udcity It's simple and classic.\n",
    "* What were some problems with the initial architecture\n",
    "    * The output is different. The origin Lenet is for MNIST, output was 10. But Traffic sign has 43 output. \n",
    "* How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? Typical adjustments could include choosing a different model architecture, adding or taking away layers (pooling, dropout, convolution, etc), using an activation function or changing the activation function. One common justification for adjusting an architecture would be due to overfitting or underfitting. A high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the validation set indicates overfitting; a low accuracy on both sets indicates underfitting.\n",
    "    * First the accuracy is relatively low, it was about 0.91. In order to improve the accuracy, I added the depth on convolution layer. For example, the output of convolution layer 1 was 28x28x6, namely, the depth was just 6. I change it to 28x28x32. I also increase the depth on output of following layer.\n",
    "    * After that, the accuracy is better. But it seems to be overfitting. So I added dropout layer too. It looks good. Pooling layer and dropout layer works well. The accuracy is similar to the training dataset and valid dataset.\n",
    "* Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why?\n",
    "    * I change the Batch size and Epochs. By increasing the batch size epoch, the test accuracy becomes better. But if batch size and epochs are too large, the accuracy will not change so much. So I finally choose the number Epochs: 25 and Batch Size: 256. \n",
    "* What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? For example, why might a convolution layer work well with this problem? How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model\n",
    "    * Dropout help with preventing overfitting. So the model becomes better.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a well known architecture was chosen:\n",
    "* What architecture was chosen?\n",
    "* Why did you believe it would be relevant to the traffic sign application?\n",
    "* How does the final model's accuracy on the training, validation and test set provide evidence that the model is working well?\n",
